Anti-Cheating In the end of each session after users long press the stop button, the Machine Learning Anti-Cheating System (System) will evaluate if users have exploited the DRIVN drive2earn mechanics. The System will add or deduct usersâ€™ Turing Score in the end of each session, user cannot start a new session before the System completes the analysis. A user starts with a 100/100 Turing Score (TS). When a userâ€™s Turing Score is below 100, the user cannot interact with the NFT marketplace, or transfer between spending and wallet accounts. If a user is moving outdoor without cheating, the Turing Score will gradually return to 100/100. The following table outlines how the System works and you accept the Turing Score and token consequences that apply in these circumstances. The following table does not limit our rights to otherwise take action in connection with your misuse of the App or the Services. * Moondriving is not part of the Systemâ€™s scrutiny, as the feedback from Moondriving is instant, whereas the System only displays the result after the end of each session. ** If the reset token earning is DRIVE, a portion of the DRIVE will go to the Schadenfreude Pool. If the reset token earning is DRIVE, it will be refunded back to the total DRIVE release of the day. 13.
